# 📊 Vendor Performance Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview
**Vendor Performance Analysis** is a comprehensive data analytics project focused on evaluating vendor efficiency using sales and purchase data. The project goes beyond surface-level sales figures to uncover deeper insights into **profitability, inventory behavior, and vendor contribution**, helping businesses make smarter procurement and sourcing decisions.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
The key objectives of this project are to:

- Establish a secure connection to a **MySQL database** and extract raw transactional data  
- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing** to ensure high-quality analysis  
- Engineer **business-critical performance metrics** for vendors  
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies  
- Generate **actionable insights** to optimize vendor selection and procurement strategy  

---

## 🗄️ Database Connection
The analysis begins with connecting to a **MySQL database** using SQLAlchemy and MySQL Connector. This demonstrates hands-on experience in real-world data retrieval, database interaction, and secure data handling.

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
To ensure accuracy and reliability, the dataset undergoes thorough preprocessing, including:

- Handling missing and inconsistent values  
- Correcting data types for numerical and categorical fields  
- Ensuring data integrity and consistency across transactions  

These steps lay a strong foundation for meaningful analysis.

## 📈 Business Metrics & Key Insights

### 🔹 Profitability Analysis
- A new metric, **GrossProfit**, was engineered to shift the focus from sales volume to actual profitability  
- The analysis revealed that **high sales volume does not always translate to high profit**, highlighting underperforming vendors hidden behind large revenues  

### 🔹 Vendor Performance Evaluation
- Vendors were ranked using summary tables for quick comparison  
- Performance discrepancies across sales, profit, and inventory behavior were identified  

---

## 📊 Data Visualization & EDA
The project leverages powerful visualizations to communicate insights effectively:

- **Histograms** – To analyze distributions of key variables such as `TotalSalesDollars` and `GrossProfit`  
- **Bar Charts & Scatter Plots** – To compare vendor performance and study relationships between metrics  
- **Summary Tables** – For ranking and benchmarking vendors at a glance  

These visual tools help uncover trends, outliers, and business-critical patterns.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Professional-grade data visualization  
- **SQLAlchemy** – Database connection and ORM support  
- **MySQL Connector** – Direct interaction with MySQL database  

---

## 💡 Key Takeaway
This project demonstrates how **data-driven vendor evaluation** can uncover hidden inefficiencies and support better procurement decisions. By focusing on profitability rather than just sales, businesses can build stronger, more cost-effective vendor relationships.
