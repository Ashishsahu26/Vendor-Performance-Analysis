Vendor Performance Analysis 
This project is a comprehensive data analysis of vendor sales and purchase data to evaluate vendor performance and provide key business insights. The analysis identifies top-performing vendors, uncovers trends in profitability and inventory management, and offers actionable recommendations to optimize procurement strategy.



Project Objective :

   The main goal of this project is to:

   Connect to a database and extract raw transactional data.

   Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.

   Engineer key business metrics to assess vendor performance.

   Visualize data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.



Database Connection:

  The analysis begins by establishing a connection to a MySQL database to securely retrieve raw data, demonstrating practical experience with database management and retrieval.

Data Preprocessing:

The notebook includes robust steps for handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring data consistency, which are crucial for reliable analysis.

Business Metrics & Insights


Profitability Analysis: GrossProfit was calculated to shift focus from mere sales volume to actual profitability, revealing that some high-volume vendors were not the most profitable.



Data Visualization

   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The project uses matplotlib and seaborn to create compelling visualizations, including:

   Histograms: To understand the distribution of key variables like TotalSalesDollars and GrossProfit.

   Bar Plots & Scatter Plots: To compare vendor performance and uncover relationships between different metrics.

   Summary Tables: To rank vendors based on their performance for quick reference.


Technologies & Libraries

   Python: The core programming language used for the analysis.

   Pandas: Essential for data manipulation and analysis.

   Numpy: Used for numerical operations.

   Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating professional-grade data visualizations.

   SQLAlchemy: To establish a robust connection to the MySQL database.

MySQL Connector: For interaction with the MySQL database.
